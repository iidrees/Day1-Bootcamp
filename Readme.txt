The tasks for today is to solve two andelab tests, 
The first Andelabs called getPrimes requires you to to find the primes of a number from 0 to n, while putting the prime numbers in this numbers in an array. you are required to also write the test cases for this program.
The second Andelabs is called dataTypes already had its tests, and it requires you to write a a program that detects data types.

The last task is to write an OOP program modelled after a real-life model. 

I was supposed to write test for the getPrimes and OOP programs, but I could only write for the getPrimes program.
